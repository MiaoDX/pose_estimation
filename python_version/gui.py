                                 parameters. This method will be called in the
                                 class constructor, after initializing common
                                 parameters, right before creating the GUI
                                 layout.
        * _create_custom_layout: A method to create a custom GUI layout. This
                                 method will be called in the class
                                 constructor, after initializing common

                                 self.panels_vertical.Add.

                                 frame. It needs to return the processed RGB
                                 frame to be displayed.
